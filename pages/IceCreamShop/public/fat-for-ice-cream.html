            <h3>What is the best source of fat for <span>ice cream</span>?</h3>
            <h6>By Admin / 10st december, 2021</h6>
            <p>There is no doubt that foods with higher levels of fat have higher acceptance rates among consumers. And ice cream is no different. Fat in ice cream has several functions, such as intervening in creaminess, softness, flavor, reducing the sensation of coldness, increasing resistance to melting, favoring the incorporation of air in the ice cream, among many others of equal importance.</p>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="information">
        <p>The best characteristics for a good ice cream recipe are achieved with fat levels between 8 and 10% of the texture.</p>

        <p>In addition, there are several fat options to make a product with different characteristics, all this depends on the result you want to obtain, but for a better understanding we present you some of the ones that can be used.</p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Hydrogenated vegetable fat:</h3>
        <p>This type of fat is one of the cheapest sources you can get in the market, but it is not only because of its price, but also because it guarantees greater resistance and the product does not melt so fast. It also adds great capacity for air incorporation and retention. However, all hydrogenated vegetable fat is trans fat, so well known for being associated with cardiovascular diseases, damaging health, if you plan to use this ingredient, it must be specified among the ingredients that are presented for the customer to decide whether to consume it or not.</p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Milk cream:</h3>
        <p>It has the best flavor characteristics for the final product. It will allow us to make creamier and finer textured ice creams, this ingredient helps to reduce the size of ice crystals formed during freezing. Its incorporation rate with air is a small problem since it is not very high.</p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Butter:</h3>
        <p>According to some research, this ingredient contains saturated fatty acids, which causes the quality of the ice cream to decrease, as well as its incorporation with air. But despite this, the butter adds flavor and texture, giving the product a higher overall quality. Being a raw material, its cost is high and it is used in "premium" ice creams.</p>

        <h3> <i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Palm fat:</h3>
        <p>This type of fat costs a little more than hydrogenated vegetable fat, but its cost benefit is that it does not contain trans fat. It allows the ice cream to have a good resistance to not melt, being its melting point better, below the same body temperature, this means that when in contact with the mouth it will not be diluted so easily. Its flavor characteristics and incorporation of air are very similar to the type of vegetable fat mentioned above.</p>

                        <p>When it comes to taking care of ourselves, we always look for low-calorie foods. However, sometimes we not only have to pay attention to calories, but also to the properties of certain foods that, at first glance, would be discarded from your diet. For example, do you know the benefits of ice cream? We show them to you.</p>

                        <p>The contrast of temperature and flavors created by these combinations is very interesting: I'm a fan of the cream that forms after a few seconds. The coffee one can be combined with all kinds of creams, but it is recommended by our own experience to combine it with sorbets such as the mango one.</p>
