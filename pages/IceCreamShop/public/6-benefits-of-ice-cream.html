            <h3>6 benefits of <span>ice cream</span></h3>
            <h6>By Admin / 10st december, 2021</h6>
            <p>When it comes to taking care of ourselves, we always look for low-calorie foods. However, sometimes we not only have to pay attention to calories, but also to the properties of certain foods that, at first glance, would be discarded from your diet. For example, do you know the benefits of ice cream? We show them to you.</p>

    <section class="information">
        <h3>What's so good about eating <span>ice cream</span>?</h3>
        <p>In warm seasons one of the foods that we have in mind are ice cream, these are preferred by all ages, but often are not consumed by their calorie index, yet there are benefits of this product.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Provides calcium</h4>
        <p>If you eat a serving of ice cream that is made from milk or yougurt, it provides your body with 15% of its daily calcium needs. Calcium is a very important mineral, it helps the growth and protection of our teeth and bones.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Proteins and vitamins</h4>
        <p>Ice cream is also rich in protein, vitamins A, B2 and B6, C, D, E, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium. This makes it a perfect food for people of all ages.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> It provides energy to your body</h4>
        <p>What you didn't know about ice cream is that it contains carbohydrates, which are essential for your body to have energy throughout the day. They also provide 10% of the calories you need per day, keep in mind that you can find ice cream without sugar or gluten to enjoy it without remorse. Another fact you should know is that most homemade ice creams contain 6% fat.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Your happiness will increase</h4>
        <p>Eating your favorite ice cream will improve your mood and can reduce depression, it is also recommended to lower the symptoms of stress, mostly flavors that especially help for these benefits are vanilla or chocolate. Why these flavors? The reason lies in the casein found in these ingredients, which is able to generate endorphins and reduce stress.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Hydration</h4>
        <p>Have you ever felt tired or down because of the heat? Well, let us tell you that on those hot days, eating a delicious ice cream gives you the hydration that your body needs at that moment.</p>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-ice-cream"></i> Everybody likes them</h4>
        <p>Over time, ice creams have been redesigned in flavors and textures, creating extraordinary combinations with fruit toppings, chocolates, among other things. If you are one of those who want to make your own combinations, it is possible that they already exist and you can try your perfect ice cream. The ice cream industry does not stop and we know that these exquisite desserts will continue to be consumed.</p>
        <h4>The benefits of ice cream after training</h4>
        <p>It is recommended to have some ice cream after training, as it nourishes muscles and relieves discomfort. 
        After the physical effort we make, our muscles need to recover quickly the glycogen that is lost. We have to keep in mind that ice cream contains proteins, sugars and high doses of vitamins, but if you are concerned about calories you can opt for low-fat and low-sugar ice creams, and you have a large number of variations currently based on milk, yogurt, skim milk, water or fruit juice.</p>
        <p>As an additional fact, it is completely false that consuming ice cream on cold days can cause colds. Nowadays, you no longer have excuses to eat ice cream, since you have a great variety in the market.</p>

                        <p>The contrast of temperature and flavors created by these combinations is very interesting: I'm a fan of the cream that forms after a few seconds. The coffee one can be combined with all kinds of creams, but it is recommended by our own experience to combine it with sorbets such as the mango one.</p>

                        <span>By admin / 10st december, 2021</span>
                        <p>There is no doubt that foods with higher levels of fat have higher acceptance rates among consumers. And ice cream is no different. Fat in ice cream has several functions, such as intervening in creaminess, softness, flavor, reducing the sensation of coldness, increasing resistance to melting, favoring the incorporation of air in the ice cream, among many others of equal importance. </p>
